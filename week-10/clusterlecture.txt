Clustering

Cultured cells w/ treated vs untreated or difference in cell type
	Looking at co-expression: reg by same factors, related functions, or function in same pathway
	ID-ing 
		Usually have heat map to start with for example-- hard to tell (noisy)
		If you cluster can do so by gene or cekk type --> if combine can get blocks of gene expression to compare

Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (super common--most heat maps incorporate a tree to show)
	Each obs starts off as a leaf--> building up a tree from the bottom leaves to roots (STARTING FROM THE TOP [LEAVES] TO BOTTOM [ROOT])
	Combines closest nodes (by similarity)

	Quantifying Similarities 
		Euclidian -- pythagorean theorem to find distance between two points
		Manhattan/City Distance-- A+B (the actual points) --> will scale with euclidian 
		Can also have squared euclidian-- emphasizing distance 
			far farther 
			close closer
	Once know how measuring distance-- choosing points to compare
		Avg of two pts and compare to the next one
		Choose which ones to compare
		Choose the maximum
		Linkage-- which nodes to use for clustering distance 
			Complete (Max)
			Single(Min)
			Average
	Decisions to make
		How to choose distance (Euclidian usually good)
		How to choose linkage-- considering groups already combined (Avg usually good, but depends on data set)
		
K-means Clustering (also common but not usually visualized)
	If each point a gene-- think two clusters have similar expression pattern
	Pick two points in range of data (not neccesarily in the cluters)
	Recalculate the points based on which point they're closer to
	Take average from each point cluster-- make the points closest to center of new spread of clutering 
	Recalculate the center-- updating assignments and centers until the posistions chosen become stable (center of mass-- starts off random)
		Will be nosiy so we'll have to adjust after visualizing 

Gene Ontology 
	OVerrrepresentation-- am I seeing more of this term than what i'd expect in a population 
	Fisher's Exact Test -- we're looking @ percentages 
	Bonferroni Correction
	
Differiential Expression
	Usually talked about log scale 
	Log 50 -- good chance significant 
	replicates and error bars are important, and absolute level of expression
	Also consider noise-- if move data, magnitude of distance
