Beads w/ nucletodies on them to help you count-- barcoded gel beads
flow in cells and proper enzymes
oil droplet with either single cell attached or none generally-- sometimes can get multiple attached though (rare)
What's on the bead?
	Unique barcode that's the same for every oligo attached to it
	UMI unique for each sequence/oligo
	Poly-dT
After getting emulsion
	Carry out RT rxn in each droplet-- populations of cDNA
	They're tagged with barcode and UMI so left (dsDNA)-- loose cells and beads throughout rxn
	Tagged by sequence that comes after PolydT-- Read 2, 3' tagging 
	Can't get isoform identification (comprehensive)
Data Analysis
	Align the read 2 sequence to genome/transcriptome to identify the gene corresponding to the molecule (STAR for 10X)
	Tabulate by cell barcode and UMI-- UMI allow account for PCR duplication to collapse multiple reads (not two molecules)
		barcode is 16 bp long and UMI 10 bp 
		 Need to account for seq errors too
		 want tolerant of seq errors  
	Results in a count table 
**Miss things that expressed @ LOW LEVELS**

Qaulity control/filerting
Normalization 
dimension reduction-- for visualization (analysis not done here but could be for downstream clustering and it can remove noise)
clustering: cells sim to ea other and diff from others (cell types) and then ANNOTATE 

Dimension Reduction-- Machine Learning/Unsupervised Learning
	Trying to take and project data into reduced dimension to reveal info about the structure of your input X
	PCA needs linearization so can't be nonlinear 
	Swissroll-- underlying structure but not linear so there's a plane that underlies this structure but it has no direction that PCA could unravel to find the 2D 
		Need manifold learning to unravel--> project ot two dimensional space
		t-SNE commonly used-- grouping things similar together but size means nothing and global orientation means nothing 
			Stochastic 
			Creating prob distribution on how any given point where likely to pick up nearest neighbor 
			place points in lower dimension space that the chance of a choosing b as neighbor is preserved 
			Have to tune to make sense of the data (trial and error)
		UMAP: assumes
			data uniformly dist
			approx the underlying manifold and finds a lower dimensional representation that preserves distance within the manifold-- manifold strucuture and approx are what matter
