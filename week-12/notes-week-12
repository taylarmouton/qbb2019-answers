Bisulfite Sequencing

T--> C high score but not C --> T: allowing T's to match C's in the reference genome but not the other way
bizmar: creates additional reference where G's read as A's (the reverse strand) in addition to the given reference and chooses based off these two alignments picks the best one --> not great but proxy of amount of methylation (new refernce called converted)

Data you get out
Get porporiton of population that's methylated 
Need depth of coverage because it's not consistent/variable in amount of methylation present 



Downloading the File 

**Made new enviroment called week-12 DNAmeth) which has bismark, igv, and sra-tools downloaded **

****NO ENVIRO BC NO WANT DOWNLOAD FASTQ-DUMP)
(base) /Users/cmdb/qbb2019-answers/week-12 $ fastq-dump -A SRR1035454 --split-files -X 1000000

**Named them according to their data
(base) /Users/cmdb/qbb2019-answers/week-12 $ mv SRR1035452_1.fastq EpiSC_mC_1.fastq

**Looking at the data
(base) /Users/cmdb/qbb2019-answers/week-12 $ open ES_f_mC_1_fastqc.html

*.fa is sequence and fastq is reads 

*Copying the file to new directory so have access 
(base) /Users/cmdb/qbb2019-answers/week-12 $ cp ../week-9/chr19.fa ./

*Creating index for mapping, uses bowtie the ./ indicates the file I want to be my index which is chr19.fa) 

bismark_genome_preparation --bowtie2 ./

*Mapping with bismark-- had to go back to enviroment created for bismark 

(week-12_DNAmeth) /Users/cmdb/qbb2019-answers/week-12 $ bismark --genome ./ -1 ES_f_mC_1.fastq -2 ES_f_mC_2.fastq
